        <p>This is a set of open source instruments developed by Blurring the Boundaries Arts in collaboration with the National accessArts Centre.</p>
        
        <p>If you're looking for the test page with the QR codes and instrument examples, hold tight! They'll be back up here soon.</p>

        <p>We have developed these instruments through a series of workshops, and we are now making them available to the public through a set of JavaScript libraries. We hope that you will find them useful, and that you will share your creations with us.</p>
