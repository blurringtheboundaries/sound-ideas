      h2 Accessibility 
      section
        p Please note: there are no instructions currently available for any instruments! We are working on this.
        p At present, all of the pages on this website have passed Google's Lighthouse checker, and have also been tested with VoiceOver for screen reader access.
        p All pages should work equally well with a keyboard, mobile touchscreen, or mouse.
        p These pages are currently text-heavy and will eventually be supplemented with images and other media.
