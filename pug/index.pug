      section
        p Please note: there are no instructions available for any instruments at this stage of development!
        p At present, all of the pages on this website have passed Google's Lighthouse checker, and have also been tested with VoiceOver for screen reader access.
        p All pages should work equally well with a keyboard, mobile touchscreen, or mouse.
        p These pages are currently text-heavy and will eventually be supplemented with images and other media.
