# Sound Ideas

A set of digital instruments and collaborative music-making tools for the web.

Developed in collaboration with [National accessArts Centre](https://accessarts.ca/) as part of their Digital Now project, through online collaboration and a series of workshops (2021-2023).

## Notes on licensing and accessibility

*Please note: since this is a project-specific repo with content generated by artists from BtB Arts and the NaAC, we have chosen not to include an open source license at this stage.*

Instead, as much as possible, we have developed the back-end code as a set of open-source libraries/modules to be published on NPM.

This is still a work in progress.  Some instruments may have limited functionality or accessibility issues. We are prioritising screen reader access alongside touch screen access, and some of our experimental designs can occasionally cause automated accessibility checkers to fail.  Although these tools are essential, our preference at BtB is to employ consultants and collaborators to work on this, rather than just meeting requirements in abstract.  If you encounter any barriers while using any of the pages, please let us know and we will do our best to fix them.

If you would like to use (or contribute to) any of the code here, or simply have any questions, get in touch!
