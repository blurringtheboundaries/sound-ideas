# Sound Ideas

A set of digital instruments and collaborative music-making tools for the web.

Developed in collaboration with [National accessArts Centre](https://accessarts.ca/) as part of their Digital Now project through online collaboration and a series of workshops (2021-2023).

*Please note: since this is a project-specific repo with content generated by artists from BtB Arts and NaAC, we have chosen not to include an open source license at this stage.*

Instead, we have developed the back-end code as a set of open-source libraries/modules to be published on NPM.
At the time of writing, this is still a work in progress, and so if you would like to use (or contribute to) any of the code here, please get in touch!

We are grateful to acknowledge the support of Canada Council for the Arts / Conseil des arts du Canada in the dvelopment of this project.
Special thanks to Joanne Cox whose project Define Your Journey formed the starting point for some of the instruments presented here.
This project also draws upon code developed during CAMIN sessions (Canadian Accessible Musical Instruments Network), with thanks to our screen reader consultants / collaborators Jason Dasent and Joel Daze.
